Voting Methods, Tabulation, and Data Interoperability

The Voting Methods, Tabulation, and Data Interoperability Working Group's (Voting Methods Working Group, (VMWG)) work product is a standard, specification and reference consisting of rigorously and precisely defined models of voting methods or modules including counting, tabulation, mathematical evaluation, and, common operations on vote data sets to support Data Interoperability. 

VMWG models include support for varieties of electoral systems or social choice theory (the rules by elections are operated) such as plurality voting, n-of-m voting, range voting, ranked choice voting, approval voting, etc.

The utility of the VMWG's models and specification is that voting methods and modules are implemented accurately and uniformly across all use cases, voting equipment, and with an interoperable Common Data Format (CDF). 

VMWG models can be configured and validated for the particular needs of the Elections Official, Election Administrator, electoral jurisdiction (e.g. state or county) and their use cases, including for functions like capacity planning, systems acceptance testing, and systems verification and testing.
